# Apache Solr (Built with Ansible Container)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ac-solr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ac-solr) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/geerlingguy/solr.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/geerlingguy/solr "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

This project is in it's extremely early stages. _There will be bugs!_ You may be better served using the [official Solr Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr/) if it meets your requirements.

This project is composed of three main parts:

  - **Ansible Container project**: This project is maintained on GitHub: [geerlingguy/ac-solr](https://hub.docker.com/r/geerlingguy/solr/). Please file issues, support requests, etc. against this GitHub repository.
  - **Docker Hub Image**: If you just want to use [the `geerlingguy/solr` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/geerlingguy/solr/) in your project, you can pull it from Docker Hub.
  - **Ansible Role**: If you need a flexible Ansible role that's compatible with both traditional servers and containerized builds, check out [`geerlingguy.solr`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/solr/) on Ansible Galaxy. (This is the Ansible role that does the bulk of the work in managing the Apache Solr container.)

## Standalone Usage

If you want to use the `geerlingguy/solr` image from Docker Hub, you don't need to install or use this project at all. You can quickly build a Solr container locally with:

    docker run -d --name=solr -p 8983:8983 geerlingguy/solr:latest /opt/solr/bin/solr start -f -force

You can also wrap up that configuration in a `Dockerfile` and/or a `docker-compose.yml` file if you want to keep things simple.

### Persistent Solr cores

TODO: Describe how to mount a volume into the container to persist core/index data and have externally-managed collection configuration.

## Management with Ansible Container

### Prerequisites

Before using this project to build and maintain a Solr images for Docker, you need to have the following installed:

  - [Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (for Mac, Windows, or Linux)
  - [Ansible Container](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container/installation.html)

### Build the image

  1. Build the Solr Docker image; run this command in the root directory:

         ansible-container --var-file vars-6.x.yml build

  1. Once the image is built, you can run `docker images` to see the `acsolr-solr` image that was generated.

Older Solr versions are also supportedâ€”specify the vars file for the version you would like to install to switch to that version of Solr. (**Note**: Until 0.9.2+ is released, you must [install and use Ansible Container from source](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container/installation.html#running-from-source) due to [this PR only being in devel so far](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/pull/609).)

### Run the image as a container

    ansible-container --var_file vars-6.x.yml run

**Note**: The `--var_file` option currently seems to not work with `run`, so you may need to just use `run` alone and paste any relevant variables into the `container.yml` file, at least until [this issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/643) is resolved.

You should be able to reach the Solr dashboard by accessing [http://localhost:8983/](http://localhost:8983/) in your browser.

(Use `stop` to stop the container, and `destroy` to reset the containers and _all_ images.)

### Push the image to Docker Hub

Currently, the process for updating this image on Docker Hub is manual. Eventually this will be automated via Travis CI using `ansible-container push` (currently, this is waiting on [this issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/630) to be resolved).

  1. Log into Docker Hub on the command line:

         docker login --username=geerlingguy

  1. Tag the latest version (only if this is the latest/default version):

         docker tag [image id] geerlingguy/solr:latest

  1. Tag the Solr major version:

         docker tag [image id] geerlingguy/solr:6.x # or 5.x, 4.x...
         docker tag [image id] geerlingguy/solr:6.6.0 # the specific version

  1. Push tags to Docker Hub:

         docker push geerlingguy/solr:latest # (if this was just tagged)
         docker push geerlingguy/solr:6.x # or 5.x, 4.x...
         docker push geerlingguy/solr:6.6.0 # the specific version
